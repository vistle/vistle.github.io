# Overview

[Vistle](https://vistle.io) is a software environment for scientific visualization of large-scale data sets. It implements a data-parallel visualization pipeline and can distribute the pipeline steps onto several interconnected clusters. Workflows are configured in an explicit graphical user interface. Vistle has a special focus on working in immersive virtual environments such as CAVEs and head-mounted displays. In order to enable visualization of large-scale data sets in such environments, object and image based remote rendering can be configured within the visualization workflows.

If you are already familiar with [COVISE](https://www.hlrs.de/covise/), this will give you a head-start because of a lot of similarities between the two systems: You can think of Vistle as a parallel version of COVISE. Refer to [](compare/covise.md) for notable differences.
