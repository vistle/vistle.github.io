# A Simple CFD Example

In this section, we will study basic visualization techniques for scalar and vector fields by working with a small CFD data set.

## The Data

The data that we will work with is the same as used in the [COVISE tutorial](https://fs.hlrs.de/projects/covise/doc/html/tutorial/index.html). It is distributed in the [COVISE source repository](https://github.com/hlrs-vis/covise/) and comes with every COVISE installation in the subdirectory `.../share/covise/example-data/tutorial`. You can also get it by downloading the raw contents of the files in [this directory](https://github.com/hlrs-vis/covise/tree/master/share/covise/example-data/tutorial) from GitHub. It is provided in native COVISE format. It shows the results of a flow simulation in a channel with two inlets and contains scalar data fields for pressure (`tiny_p.covise`), temperature (`tiny_te.covise`) and viscosity (`tiny_vis.covise`) as well as the velocity vector field (`tiny_ve.covise`) on an unstructured grid (`tiny_geo.covise`).

### Reading the Data

Reading of data in COVISE format is accomplished with the [](project:#mod-ReadCovise) or [](project:#mod-ReadCoviseDirectory) modules. Both can read up to three fields mapped onto the same grid. The first can handle grid and field data at arbitrary locations in the filesystem. The latter requires that grid and field data reside in the same directory â€“ with the advantage of a more comfortable user interface for selecting the fields to be read.

To start, drag *ReadCoviseDirectory* from the module library to the empty canvas in the center of the graphical user interface. This will start the module and show a representation of it as a turquoise box.
Then continue with selecting the directory where to find the data. This is a [parameter](../gui/gui.md#module-browser-and-parameters) of the module.
Select the module by clicking on the turquoise box. A pink outline indicates that this module is selected.
The user interface will show the parameters of this module in the [parameter area](../gui/gui.md#module-browser-and-parameters).
Make sure that only this module is selected -- otherwise the GUI will not enable the module parameters view.

In the area labeled *Parameters: ReadCoviseDirectory* find the line for the *directory* parameter and click on the folder icon.
This will bring up a file browser window.
Use it to navigate to the directory where you have the COVISE source code. From there, continue to `share/covise/example-data/tutorial` and click on *Choose*.
The module will search the directory for files with the extension `.covise` and will present them in the parameter combo boxes (drop down lists) for *grid*, *normals*, and the data fields *field0*, *field1*, ...

At this stage, we are only interested in the geometric structure of the computational domain.
So it is sufficient to select `tiny_geo` on the *grid* parameter.
Execute the workflow by double-clicking on the module or by clicking on the *gears* icon in the toolbar.

[Workflow geo-read](vistle:///open#workflow/tutorial/geo-read) shows the module with the selected directory and the grid file.

## Examining the Geometry

Here we will study techniques to visualize the geometry of the computational domain.
This will also help you to provide context for the visualization of the scalar and vector fields.

### Find the Extents of the Geometry Domain

The [](project:#mod-BoundingBox) module takes its geometry input and finds global minimum and maximum values for its coordinates. The result of this process can be seen in its parameter window as the values of the `min` and `max` parameters. And of course, it can compute a tight axis-aligned cuboid around the domain of the data. This surrounding box can guide you to the interesting areas of space, it can provide visual clues that help with orientation in 3D space.
The numerical values can be used to provide input for modules requiring coordinates as parameter input.

This bounding box can also be inspected visually by loading it into the [](project:#mod-COVER) renderer. This will open up another window. Connect the output of *BoundingBox* to the input of *COVER* and rerun the workflow.
You can bring the bounding box into view by clicking on the *View All* icon in the toolbar right of the animation controls in the *COVER* window. This will show the bounding box in a light gray color.
In order to get an idea of the location and size of the bounding box, you can enable a unit sized coordinate system in the renderer by enabling it with the *View Options* -> *Show axis* in the menu of the *COVER* window.
The coordinate system will be shown in red, green, and blue colors for the *x*, *y*, and *z* axes, respectively.

[Workflow geo-bounds](vistle:///open#workflow/tutorial/geo-bounds) shows how to compute and display geometry bounding box.


### Show the Boundary of the Geometry Domain

The shape of the computational domain can be visualized with the [](project:#mod-DomainSurface) module. It is available from its first, i.e. left-most output. After connecting it to *COVER* and executing the workflow, it will show the outer surface of the geometry in a light gray color.
If you are interested what triangles make up this surface, you can show visualize them by switching to *Wireframe* in the *View options* -> *Draw style* menu of *COVER*. This will show the outlines of the triangles.

It also provides a second output port providing lines showing the edges of the domain.
Currently, this is only a rough approximation, as only those edges that do not neighbor with other cells are shown.
Connect also this second output to the input of *COVER* and execute the workflow again.

[Workflow geo-surface](vistle:///open#workflow/tutorial/geo-surface) shows how to compute the geometric domain.

### Show the Tessellation of the Geometry Domain

Often, the computational domain is discretized by subdividing it into cells.
The module [ShowGrid](project:#mod-ShowGrid) can be used to visualize this subdivision.
Different to using *DomainSurface* together with the *Wireframe* draw style, this will show you what goes on inside the domain.

In order to peek into the domain, it is necessary to disconnect the first output of *DomainSurface* from the input of *COVER*.
Do so by double-clicking on the line representing this connection.
Then connect the output of *ShowGrid* to the input of *COVER* and execute the workflow again.

:::note
Showing the outline of a large number of cells can be very taxing on the graphics hardware,
especially for NVIDIA gaming cards.
Restrict the cells to show by selecting only specific types of cells or by supplying a list of cell IDs.

[Workflow geo-grid](vistle:///open#workflow/tutorial/geo-grid) illustrates how to show a subset of the grid's cells.


### Clip Geometry at a Plane or Basic Shapes

You might want to see the inside of the computational domain, but still retain parts of the outer surface.
In order to do so, you need to cut the geometry open.
Vistle provides two modules for this purpose: the [](project:#mod-CutGeometry) and the [](project:#mod-ClipVtkm) module.
They perform similar tasks, but are subject to different limitations.

* The *CutGeometry* module is able to process triangular and polygonal meshes and will ignore any mapped data (e.g. scalar or vector fields) on the geometry.

* The *ClipVtkm* module is able to process unstructured grids and will also clip mapped data. It is not able to work on polygonal (or general polyhedral) meshes.
As it is based on the [Viskores](../../advanced/accel/viskores.md) library, it is able to process large datasets in parallel.

We build on the workflow from the previous section. We want to show a bit of the outer shell of the domain, but also get a view inside.
So we add the add the *CutGeometry* module and connect its input to the first output of *DomainSurface* and its output to *COVER*.
You can adjust the location of the clip by switching to the *COVER* window and enabling the *Pick interactor* in the *Vistle* -> *CutGeometry_?* menu.
This will bring up a 3D manipulator in the *COVER* window.
Drag with the mouse on the sphere to move the plane and change its orientation by moving the tip of the arrow.
When satisfied, disable it again by deselecting the *Pick interactor* in the menu.

We also want to show cell structure within a spherical subset of the domain.
To do so, we add the *ClipVtkm* module and connect its input to the output of *ReadCoviseDirectory* and its output to the input of the existing *ShowGrid* module.
This will cut the direct connection between *ReadCoviseDirectory* and *ShowGrid*.
Make sure to enable visualization of all grid cells supplied to *ShowGrid* by changing its `cells` parameter to `all`.
Now continue to adjust the location of the clip by switching to the *COVER* window and enabling the *Pick interactor* in the *Vistle* -> *ClipVtkm_?* menu.
Also use this menu in order to change the *Surface style* from *Plane* to *Sphere*.
Also check the *Invert* menu entry to show the inside of the sphere.
You can adjust the sphere location by moving the sphere manipulator with the cross hairs in the *COVER* window and its radius by dragging the other sphere manipulator.

[Workflow geo-cut](vistle:///open#workflow/tutorial/geo-cut) illustrates the results of the geometry clipping operations.


## Visualizing Scalar Fields

Up to now, we have only looked at the geometry input for the simulation.
Let's continue with the scalar fields.

### Read in an Additional Scalar Field

In order to visualize the scalar fields, we need to read them in first.
We continue where we left off in the previous section.
We remove the the *ClipVtkm* branch from the workflow by selecting both the *ClipVtkm* and *ShowGrid* modules.
From the context menu on either of the selected modules, invoke *Delete Selected*.
Then we configure the *ReadCoviseDirectory* module to also read in the pressure field:
select the *ReadCoviseDirectory* module and select `tiny_p` from the list of available fields in the *field0* parameter.

[Workflow press-read](vistle:///open#workflow/tutorial/press-read) adds reading the pressure field.

### Explore Scalar Fields via Level Sets with the *IsoSurface* Module

The [](project:#mod-IsoSurface) module can be used to extract level sets from the scalar fields.
It will create a surface mesh that represents the points in the scalar field where a given value is found.
This technique is often used to visualize the shape of a scalar field.
We are going to apply it to the pressure field.
Add an *IsoSurface* module to the workflow and connect its first input to the second output (providing the pressure field) of *ReadCoviseDirectory*.
Then connect its output to the input of *COVER*.
Executing the workflow will show the surface of the pressure field in the *COVER* window.
You can adjust the isovalue by selecting the *IsoSurface* module and changing the `isovalue` parameter in its parameter window.
You can also use the slider in the *Vistle* -> *IsoSurface_?* menu to adjust the isovalue interactively.
Another way to adjust the isovalue is to enable the *Pick interactor* from this menu: now you can drag the sphere to choose a point that provides the isovalue.
For now, this isosurface will always be shown in a light gray color.

[Workflow press-iso](vistle:///open#workflow/tutorial/press-iso) explores the pressure field via level sets.

### Provide a Color Mapping/Transfer Function for the Scalar Field

Then add a [](project:#mod-Color) module to the workflow and connect its input to the second output of *ReadCoviseDirectory*.
This forwards the pressure field to the *Color* module, so that it can detect its minimum and maximum values.
This will be used to provide a color mapping (i.e. transfer function) for the pressure field on its second output.
Connect this to the *COVER* renderer.
Now, the *Vistle* -> *Color* menu in the *COVER* window will have an entry for this color map.
You can interact with the color map either via this *Color_?* sub-menu or via the *Color* module's parameter dialog in the user interface.
You can make display a color legend by checking the *Show* entry in the *Color_?* sub-menu.
You will notice that this *Color* module carries the label `tiny_p`.
This means that this color map is used for all subsequent modules that are connected to the second output of *ReadCoviseDirectory*.

Let's revisit our isosurface. What about coloring it according to the pressure field so that its color changes whenever we change the value?
For that purpose, the *IsoSurface* module provides a second input tË™hat provides a scalar field to map onto the isosurface.
So we connect the second output of *ReadCoviseDirectory* another time to *IsoSurface*, but now to its second input.
You could use the *Pick interactor* to adjust the isovalue interactively...

[Workflow press-color](vistle:///open#workflow/tutorial/press-color) explores the pressure field via level sets.

### Slice a Scalar Field with *CuttingSurface*

We finish exploring the pressure field by slicing it with the [](project:#mod-CuttingSurface) module.
Add a *CuttingSurface* module to the workflow and connect its input to the second output of *ReadCoviseDirectory*.
Then connect its output to the input of *COVER*.
Execute the workflow and you will see a plane slicing through the pressure field.
You can adjust the position of the plane by selecting the *CuttingSurface* module and changing the `point` (a point on the plane) and `vertex` parameters in its parameter window.
Or you can use the *Vistle* -> *CuttingSurface_?* menu in the *COVER* window to adjust the position of the plane interactively by enabling the corresponding *Pick interactor*.
Now let's make use of the color mapping.

[Workflow press-cut](vistle:///open#workflow/tutorial/press-cut) shows the pressure field sliced with a plane.
