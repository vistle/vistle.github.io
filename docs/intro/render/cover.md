## The COVER Renderer ##

COVER is the module responsible for displaying the 3D scene. You can use it on a desktop, but it works as well an immersive multi-screen projection system and with VR glasses. Here, we learn how to use it when configured for the desktop. Although it can be used independent from a visualization system (i.e. COVISE or Vistle), we will only look at how to use it with Vistle.

The 3D render area shows the visualization scene. Clicking into it allows navigation within the scene. It also shows a 3D floating menu, which is mainly used for interaction from immersive virtual environments. But as not all functionality is exposed from the desktop menu, you might need to resort to it.
