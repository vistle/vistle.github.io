# Getting Started

In the following, we assume that your system administrator has provided you with a working installation of Vistle. If you need to install Vistle, please consult [GitHub](https://github.com/vistle/vistle).

## Starting Vistle

On UNIX (Linux and macOS) and Windows, you should be able to start Vistle by typing `vistle` into a terminal window. If you want to open an existing workflow, you can do so by appending the workflow description (stored in a file with the extension `.vsl`) file on the command line. You can see a short description of supported command line arguments by invoking `vistle -h`.

Just typing `vistle` will also start its [graphical user interface](../gui/gui.md) where you can configure [workflows](../workflow/workflow.md).
