[Simulation](../../module/simulation/index) modules provide a direct link to a simulation that is still on-going. They enable acquiring data from running simulations for in situ processing, bypassing file I/O.
Together with [Read](../../module/read/index) modules they provide the sources of the workflow.
Interfaces to several in situ visualization frameworks are provided. Details can be found in the [Library Documentation](../develop/api/libsim_link.md).
