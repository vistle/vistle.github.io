The [UniViz](../../module/univiz/index) flow visualization modules build on a common framework
enabling them to be used within several visualization systems.
They are categorized together solely based on their provenance.
They have been implemented by Filip Sadlo for [AVS](https://www.avs.com/avs-express/), [COVISE](https://www.hlrs.de/covise) and [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org),
and have been ported to Vistle later.
