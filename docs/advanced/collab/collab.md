## Collaborative Sessions ##

Building on the ability to distribute workflows across many systems, Vistle also allows for setting up collaborative sessions between several users. This enables working together with a visualization despite not being in the same place. This requires to attach a Vistle instance with a user interface to a primary hub.
Instances of the [](project:#mod-COVER) renderer will be started simultaneously on all connected systems with a user interface.
In the renderer, the same data will be loaded and displayed on all systems.
Avatars representing the remote users will be shown in the 3D scene in the renderer.
Depending on the collaboration mode, the users will be able to move independently in the scene or one user will guide the others.
