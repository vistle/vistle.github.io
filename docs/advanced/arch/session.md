# Anatomy of a Vistle Session

When you start Vistle by invoking `vistle`, you start a Vistle *hub*. This is a central process that controls the Vistle session. It opens a TCP port, usually 31093, but if this port is already in use, it will choose a different one. It will report the chosen port on screen. It continues to spawn an MPI-parallel *cluster manager* process so that it runs on every MPI rank. This is done by the script `spawn_vistle.sh` (on UNIX, or `spawn_vistle.bat` on Windows). The manager process then connects to the hub's TCP port. The hub also spawns a *user interface* process, which also connects to its TCP port. Every module has to be executed in a way so that an MPI rank of the module runs on the same node as the same rank of the manager. This is required for shared memory communication between the manager and the modules.
