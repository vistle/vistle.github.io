# More Information

Another source of information is [documentation](https://fs.hlrs.de/projects/covise/doc/html/index.html) on Vistle's predecessor [COVISE](https://hlrs.de/covise), as both systems share many ideas.

If you have questions, then you should post to the Vistle users' mailing list. There, you can also reach the developers. You can subscribe at <https://listserv.uni-stuttgart.de/mailman/listinfo/vistle-users>.

Last but not least, the definitive source for information on Vistle is its source code. It is available on GitHub: <https://github.com/vistle/vistle>.
